[00:07.10]Hot and dangerous
[00:08.95]If you're one of us, then roll with us
[00:10.72]‘Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
[00:12.78]And we've got hotpants on enough
[00:14.80]And yes of course because we're running this town just like a club
[00:18.85]And no, you don't wanna mess with us
[00:21.09]Got Jesus on my necklace 
[00:22.39]
[00:23.77]I've got that glitter on my eyes
[00:25.66]Stockings ripped all up the side
[00:31.26]Looking sick and sexy-fied
[00:35.50]So let's go-o-o (Let's go!)
[00:38.74]
[00:39.27]CHORUS:
[00:39.58]Tonight we're going hard
[00:42.41]Just like the world is ours
[00:46.78]We're tearin' it apart
[00:50.58]You know we're superstars
[00:53.00]We are who we are!
[00:54.85]
[00:55.31]We're dancing like we're dumb
[00:58.61]Our bodies go numb
[01:02.48]We'll be forever young
[01:06.53]You know we're superstars
[01:09.00]We are who we are!
[01:10.78]
[01:11.50]DJ turn it up
[01:13.15]It's about damn time to live it up
[01:14.93]I'm so sick of being so serious
[01:16.75]It's making my brain delirious!
[01:18.66]
[01:18.93]I'm just talkin' truth
[01:20.97]I'm telling you 'bout the s— we do
[01:23.06]We're sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars
[01:24.95]Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes (HARD!)
[01:27.19]
[01:27.97]I've got that glitter on my eyes
[01:30.31]Stockings ripped all up the side
[01:34.62]Looking sick and sexy-fied
[01:39.47]So let's go-o-o (Let's go!)
[01:43.31]Tonight we're going hard
[01:46.70]Just like the world is ours
[01:50.71]We're tearin' it apart
